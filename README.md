Our goal is to detremie if there is any correlation betwen shot output success and distance of the shot, if there is one, Adtionally, we would like to determine if there is a correlation based on advanced team and player metrics, which looks at team records, plate effienciy offensiely as well as the player effienency defenslvely. We selected this topic because we wanted to see what the potenial outcomes are based on theis data and the correlations that exist. Furtermore, we feel that based on this data we can predict how certain players can performa based on the spcae they can create from their nerast defender based on defender height and defender distance.

## Questions we want to answer
- Is there strong correlations between defender height and a shot being missed?

- Is there a strong correlation of a player making a basket if the closest defender is more than 6 feet away from the shooter?

- Does being on the home team give star players a better shooting percentage?

- Do we need to add more data to get a high accuracy score when using a machine learning model?

## Resampling method -- first try with merged data sets shots_log and player_stats
