# NBA_Final-Project

## Project Goal

Our initial goal is to see if there is any correlation betwen shot output success and distance it was done plus any other metrics. We selected this topic because we wanted to see different trends/ possible correlations if any for differen't types of players either missing or making a basket.

## Questions we want to answer
Is there strong correlations between defender height and a shot being missed?
Is there a strong correlation of a player making a basket if the closest defender is more than 6 feet away from the shooter?
Does being on the home team give star players a better shooting percentage?
Do we need to add more data to get a high accuracy score when using a machine learning model?

## Resampling method -- first try with merged data sets shots_log and player_stats
