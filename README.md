Most recently we have been working on a project with NBA data. The data comes from two different spreadsheets, one of the spread sheets had a "shot-log" of every occurrence in the NBA season while the other sheet was the players heights, weight etc. we combined these sheets so that each and every instance would have the player who was committing the basket and the defender. After combining these two sheets we can make a successful analysis of what players should defend the person shooting the ball and vice-versa who should be shooting the ball in certain situations.
