# NBA_Final-Project

## Project Goal

Our goal is to determine if there is any correlation between with our features(SHOT_DIST,CLOSE_DEF_DIST,Height(CD)..)selected and if the player is successful or not making the basket(SHOT_RESULT). If there is a correlation we would like to see what other features from different data not in our current set have a strong correlation to the shot_result output such as advanced player metrics. We selected this topic because we want to see what the potenial outcomes are based on the data we have chosen. Furthermore, we feel that based on this data we can predict how certain players will perform by the spacing they create from the nearest defender.


## Questions we want to answer
- Is there strong correlations between defender height and a shot being missed?

- Is there a strong correlation of a player making a basket if the closest defender is more than 6 feet away from the shooter?

- Does being on the home team give star players a better shooting percentage?

- Do we need to add more data to get a high accuracy score when using a machine learning model?

## Resampling method -- first try with merged data sets shots_log and player_stats
