### NBA_Final-Project


Based on our final data, we do not see much correlation between shot result and closest defender distance, as we thought at the beginning of the project. Based on the data we hava, the most impact on whether the shot will be successful or not, is actually shot distance.

We ran multiple machine learning models, but the most accuracy we were able to achieve with the Easy Ensemble.
